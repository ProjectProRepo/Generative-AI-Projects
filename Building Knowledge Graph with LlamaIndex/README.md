# Build a Knowledge Graph RAG with LlamaIndex for Data Analysis

## Overview

Financial markets generate vast amounts of data every second, including stock prices, news updates, industry trends, and economic reports. Analyzing this data is critical for investors and analysts to make informed decisions and manage risks. Traditional methods, which rely on manual efforts or basic extraction tools, are often time-consuming, error-prone, and limited in uncovering complex relationships between entities such as companies, sectors, and stocks.

This project introduces an **AI-powered Knowledge Graph RAG system** that leverages **LlamaIndex**, **Neo4j**, **web scraping**, and **OpenAI GPT models** to transform unstructured market data into actionable insights. By combining generative AI, natural language processing (NLP), and knowledge graph construction, this system allows users to explore market sentiment, uncover hidden patterns, and make intelligent, context-aware financial decisions efficiently.

> **Note:** Ensure completion of the **LLM Project for building and fine-tuning large language models** before starting this project.

## Project Objectives

- Automate financial data extraction using **web scraping** and APIs.  
- Build a **knowledge graph** to represent relationships between entities like companies, sectors, and market trends.  
- Utilize **LlamaIndex** for vector embeddings and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).  
- Query the knowledge graph to generate **context-aware insights**.  
- Integrate **OpenAI GPT-4o** for generating actionable, natural language responses.  
- Handle unstructured market data efficiently and provide intelligent analysis for decision-making.  

## Introduction to Knowledge Graph RAG for Market Analysis

Financial market analysis requires connecting vast amounts of diverse data to uncover insights. This project demonstrates how **generative AI** can automate and enhance this process. Using a combination of **web scraping, Neo4j knowledge graphs, and LlamaIndex embeddings**, we construct a system that captures the relationships between market entities and enables dynamic querying.  

The system works as a **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline**, where vector embeddings of the financial data allow the AI model to retrieve relevant information quickly. By querying this knowledge graph, the assistant provides **personalized, context-aware insights**, such as identifying emerging trends, assessing market sentiment, or highlighting relationships between companies and sectors.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this project, ensure you have:

- Completed the **LLM Project** for building and fine-tuning large language models.  
- Basic knowledge of **Python**, **virtual environments**, and dependency management.  
- Understanding of **prompt engineering** and working with LLMs.  
- Familiarity with **Neo4j** and vector-based retrieval methods.  

## Aim

The aim of this project is to **analyze financial market sentiment** by leveraging AI to automate data collection, structure insights into a knowledge graph, and provide actionable recommendations for informed financial decisions.

## Data Description

- **Financial Market Data**: Real-time stock feeds, price movements, and indices.  
- **News and Reports**: Financial news articles, market reports, and industry updates.  
- **Knowledge Graph Entities**: Companies, sectors, market trends, and relationships extracted from unstructured data.  

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.10  
- **Libraries**: pandas, BeautifulSoup, requests, neo4j, LlamaIndex, openai  
- **Models**: OpenAI GPT-4o  

## Solution Approach

### 1. Data Collection
