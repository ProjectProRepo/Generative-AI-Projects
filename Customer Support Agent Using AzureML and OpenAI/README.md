# Build a Customer Support Agent using OpenAI and AzureML

## Overview

Managing high volumes of customer support tickets is a significant challenge for businesses, often leading to delayed responses, misprioritization, and inconsistent customer service. This project leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate ticket categorization, prioritization, and response generation, ensuring improved efficiency and customer satisfaction.

By integrating OpenAI's powerful language models with Azure ML, this project enables AI-driven customer support automation, reducing operational costs and improving response times.

## Project Objectives

- Automate ticket categorization and prioritization using LLMs.
- Generate accurate and contextually appropriate responses for customer queries.
- Utilize Azure ML for model deployment, scalability, and management.
- Implement a vector database for efficient text retrieval.
- Develop a user-friendly Streamlit application to interact with the AI assistant.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this project, ensure you have:

- [Knowledge of LLMs](https://www.projectpro.io/article/large-language-models/958)
- [Vector Databases](https://www.projectpro.io/article/vector-databases/903)
- Prompt Engineering
- Proficiency in Python and Streamlit
- [Completed the prerequisite project on building and fine-tuning a large language model](https://www.projectpro.io/project-use-case/llm-project-for-beginners-to-build-and-fine-tune-an-llm)
- An Azure account (review pricing details for service usage).
## Data Description

The project utilizes a retail CSV dataset containing customer support ticket data, categorized by issue type with corresponding responses.
