# Build and Deploy Text-2-SQL LLM Using OpenAI and AWS

## Overview

In today's data-driven world, organizations depend on SQL to retrieve and manipulate information stored in relational databases. However, many professionals, including business analysts and managers, lack SQL expertise, creating a bottleneck in data accessibility. This project aims to bridge that gap by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert natural language queries into optimized SQL commands.

By integrating OpenAI's language models with AWS cloud services, this project enables a seamless Text-to-SQL experience, improving accessibility, reducing reliance on SQL experts, and accelerating data-driven decision-making.

## Project Objectives

- Develop an AI-powered tool that translates natural language queries into SQL.
- Automate query optimization and validation for enhanced performance.
- Implement robust error handling to manage query generation and execution issues.
- Integrate a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit.
- Deploy the application securely on AWS EC2.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this project, ensure you have:

- Basic knowledge of LLMs and Prompt Engineering.
- Proficiency in Python and Streamlit.
- Understanding of SQL and relational databases.
- Experience with cloud services (AWS, Azure).
- A registered AWS account (review pricing details for service usage).

## Data Description

The project utilizes a food delivery application database, containing records of users, restaurants, menu items, orders, payments, and reviews. This structured dataset supports SQL query generation for analytics and insights.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.10
- **Libraries**: LangChain, OpenAI, Streamlit, Databricks
- **Model**: OpenAI GPT-4
- **Cloud Platform**: AWS EC2, Databricks, Snowflake

## Expected Outcomes

By completing this project, you will:

- Understand how to automate SQL generation using LLMs.
- Learn prompt engineering techniques to refine query accuracy.
- Gain experience in cloud-based deployment using AWS.
- Implement user authentication and session management.
- Optimize query performance for better efficiency and reliability.


## Important Notes

Utilizing AWS services may incur costs based on usage. Review AWS documentation to understand pricing structures and avoid unexpected charges.
