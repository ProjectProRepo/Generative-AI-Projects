# Build Deep Autoencoders Model for Anomaly Detection in Python

## Overview

Autoencoders are deep learning models designed to learn compressed representations of raw data using an **encoder** and **decoder** structure. They are widely used for **anomaly detection** by learning the normal data distribution and identifying deviations. In this project, we will build and deploy a deep autoencoder model for anomaly detection using Flask.

## Project Objectives

- Understand the **theory behind autoencoders** and their architecture.
- Develop a **deep learning model** based on autoencoders to detect anomalies in transaction data.
- Learn the difference between **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **Autoencoders**.
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset.
- Preprocess data by **cleaning and normalizing** it for optimal model performance.
- Implement and tune an **autoencoder model using Keras**.
- Deploy the trained model as an **API endpoint using Flask**.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this project, ensure you have:

- Basic knowledge of **deep learning** and **anomaly detection**.
- Understanding of **neural network architectures**, including encoders and decoders.
- Experience with **Python and Keras** for model implementation.
- Familiarity with **Flask** for model deployment.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project is a **transaction dataset**, containing **100K+ transactions** across multiple features. The dataset represents normal and potentially fraudulent transactions, making it ideal for training an autoencoder to detect anomalies.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Keras, TensorFlow
- **API Service**: Flask, Gunicorn

## Expected Outcomes

By completing this project, you will:

- Learn **how autoencoders work** and how they are used for **anomaly detection**.
- Develop a deep autoencoder model for detecting abnormal transactions.
- Understand the importance of **data preprocessing** (cleaning, normalization, and imputation).
- Tune an **autoencoder model** for improved anomaly detection.
- Deploy the model as a **Flask API** to serve real-time predictions.

## Important Notes

- Ensure Flask is properly configured for **scalability** and **security**.
- Consider using **GPU-accelerated training** for improved model performance.
- Flask API deployment may require additional server configurations (e.g., Nginx, Gunicorn, Docker).
