# AI Video Summarization Project using Mixtral, Whisper, and AWS

## Overview

In today's fast-paced digital landscape, there is a significant demand for efficient educational tools. Traditional learning methods are rapidly evolving, with an increasing prevalence of video-based content. However, the abundance of educational videos available online presents a challenge for learners trying to extract key concepts effectively. This highlights the need for a comprehensive tool that can summarize videos and generate quizzes to help learners understand and retain essential information.

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like Mixtral and Whisper is transforming the landscape of educational technology platforms. These powerful models use advanced natural language processing techniques to quickly understand and process complex educational content.

This project aims to address the growing need for effective educational tools by developing a robust video summarization and quiz generation application powered by state-of-the-art LLMs. By leveraging technologies like Mixtral and Whisper, the platform will extract key insights from educational videos, condense them into concise summaries, and generate quizzes to test comprehension. The project involves implementing a user interface and running the application on AWS cloud infrastructure, including integrating feedback mechanisms to continuously improve the learning experience.

## Project Objectives

- Develop an AI-powered tool for video summarization and quiz generation.
- Automate audio transcription using the Whisper model.
- Generate concise video summaries using Mixtral.
- Create quizzes dynamically based on transcribed text.
- Implement a user-friendly web interface for file uploads and quiz interaction.
- Deploy the application securely on AWS EC2 with GPU support.
- Store user feedback in a database for continuous improvement.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this project, ensure you have:

- Knowledge of LLMs, vector databases, and prompt engineering.
- Proficiency in Python and Flask.
