# CycleGAN Implementation for Image-To-Image Translation  

## Overview  

What if you could generate a **self-portrait in the style of Vincent van Gogh**? Sounds impossible, right? However, with **CycleGAN**, this is achievable! **CycleGAN** is a powerful model developed for **unpaired image-to-image translation**, enabling tasks such as **photo enhancement, season transfer, and artistic style conversion**.  

Unlike traditional **GANs**, which require paired datasets, **CycleGAN learns to translate images from one domain to another without needing a direct correspondence** between input and output images. In this project, you will build **CycleGAN from scratch using PyTorch**, understand its core components, and explore its real-world applications.  

## Project Objectives  

- Understand the **CycleGAN model** and its **applications**.  
- Learn about **CycleGAN architecture** and its key components.  
- Explore the differences between **Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and ResNet**.  
- Implement **Cycle Consistency Loss, Identity Loss, and PatchGAN Loss**.  
- Train a **CycleGAN model in PyTorch** for unpaired image translation.  
- Use **Reflection Padding and Instance Normalization** to enhance model performance.  

## Prerequisites  

Before starting this project, ensure you have:  

- Completed [**PyTorch Project to Build a GAN Model on MNIST Dataset**](<https://www.projectpro.io/project-use-case/gan-mnist-pytorch>).  
- Basic knowledge of [**Neural Networks, GANs, and PyTorch**](<https://www.projectpro.io/project-use-case/pytorch-neural-network-from-scratch>).  
- Understanding of **ResNet architecture and image preprocessing**.  
- Access to a **GPU-enabled environment (Google Colab recommended for training CycleGAN)**.  

## Data Description  

The dataset used for this project contains:  

- **Domain A**: Horse images.  
- **Domain B**: Zebra images.  
- **Train/Test Split**: Images are divided into **training and test sets**.  

## Tech Stack  

- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: PyTorch, Torchvision, NumPy, Pillow  

## Expected Outcomes  

By completing this project, you will:  

- Gain a deep understanding of **CycleGAN and unpaired image translation**.  
- Implement **CycleGAN from scratch in PyTorch**.  
- Train a **CycleGAN model** for **horse-to-zebra** and **zebra-to-horse** translation.  
- Learn to **fine-tune and optimize** GAN models for better performance.  
- Explore **real-world applications** of CycleGAN in style transfer and image enhancement.  

## Challenges in Training CycleGAN  

- **Mode Collapse**: The Generator may learn to produce similar outputs, reducing diversity.  
- **Training Stability**: CycleGAN requires careful **hyperparameter tuning** to achieve stable training.  
- **Cycle Consistency Constraint**: Ensuring proper image reconstruction can be challenging.  
- **Longer Training Time**: Since CycleGAN processes two generators and two discriminators, training is more computationally expensive.  

## Important Notes  

- **Google Colab GPU Usage**: Training CycleGAN requires **high computational resources**. Enable **GPU acceleration** (`Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU`).  
- **Tuning Hyperparameters**: Experiment with **learning rates, batch sizes, and architectures** for better results.  
- **Dataset Variations**: CycleGAN works best on datasets with **distinct domain differences** (e.g., horses vs. zebras, summer vs. winter).
