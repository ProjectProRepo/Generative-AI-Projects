# Build a Customer Support Agent using OpenAI and Azure ML

## Overview

Handling high volumes of customer support tickets is challenging, often leading to delayed responses, inconsistent answers, and frustrated customers. This project leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Azure ML** to automate ticket categorization, prioritization, and response generation. By combining **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, vector databases, and LLMs, the system provides accurate, context-aware, and human-like responses at scale.

This solution enhances efficiency, reduces operational costs, and ensures consistent, high-quality support for customers, transforming the traditional support workflow into a modern AI-powered process.

> **Note:** Completion of the **LLM Fine-Tuning Project** is recommended before starting this project.

- Set up and configure an **Azure ML workspace** for project management and model deployment.  
- Implement **Azure ML pipelines** to automate AI workflows.  
- Use **OpenAI embeddings** to convert text data into vectors for efficient retrieval.  
- Implement a **vector database** (FAISS) to store and retrieve embeddings.  
- Learn and implement **RAG principles** combining retrieval and generation.  
- Generate responses using LLMs based on retrieved data.  
- Generate multiple response candidates and select the best answer.  
- Build a **Streamlit UI** for a user-friendly demonstration.  
- Create a **feedback loop** for prompt and model improvements.  
- Deploy the AI system on **Azure ML** for scalability and reliability.

## Aim

The aim of this project is to develop an **AI-driven customer support system** that automates:  
1. Ticket categorization and prioritization.  
2. Response generation using context-aware LLMs.  
3. Integration of retrieval and generation through **RAG**.  
4. Scalable deployment with Azure ML.  

This system improves response times, reduces manual workload, and enhances customer satisfaction.
