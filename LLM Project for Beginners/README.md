# LLM Project to Build and Fine-Tune a Large Language Model

## Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing various industries with their advanced natural language processing capabilities. Below are some examples of LLM applications across various domains:

- **Customer Support**: LLM-powered chatbots efficiently handle inquiries, enhancing customer support experiences.
- **Content Generation**: LLMs create personalized product descriptions, news articles, and marketing materials.
- **Healthcare**: LLMs analyze medical records, diagnose diseases, and generate patient reports.
- **Finance**: Used for sentiment analysis, automated report generation, and market trend prediction.
- **Legal Industry**: Assists in legal research, contract analysis, and document drafting.
- **Education**: Automates grading, provides tutoring, and generates personalized learning content.
- **Entertainment**: Enhances recommendations for movies, music, and articles.
- **Research**: Aids in literature review, data analysis, and hypothesis generation.

This LLM project for beginners is your gateway into the world of large language models (LLMs). It starts with foundational concepts such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and gradually introduces advanced deep learning architectures, including the Transformer model, attention mechanisms, and LLMs. The project provides hands-on experience in building a knowledge-grounded chatbot.

## Project Objectives

- Gain a comprehensive understanding of LLMs and their applications.
- Learn about transformers, tokenizers, embeddings, and attention mechanisms.
- Implement text generation and dialogue summarization using LLMs.
- Explore prompt engineering, fine-tuning techniques (LoRA, PEFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).
- Develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for knowledge grounding.
- Build and deploy a chatbot application for an e-commerce use case.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this project, ensure you have:

- Basic knowledge of LLMs, vector databases, and prompt engineering.
- Proficiency in Python.
- Understanding of NLP concepts and Transformer architectures.
- Familiarity with cloud platforms for scalable computing.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.8
- **Libraries**: transformers, datasets, torchdata, torch, streamlit, openai, langchain, unstructured, sentence-transformers, chromadb, evaluate, rouge_score, loralib, peft
- **Model**: OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo, FLAN-T5
- **Cloud Platform**: Amazon EC2 (optional for scalability)

### System Requirements
