# Microsoft Fabric Project to Build a Financial Reporting Agent

## Overview

Financial advisors and wealth management firms deal with large volumes of diverse financial data, including client portfolios, transaction histories, and market assets. Efficiently consolidating, analyzing, and visualizing this data is critical for informed decision-making.  

This project introduces a **Financial Reporting Agent** built on **Microsoft Fabric**, leveraging OneLake, lakehouse architecture, and the Fabric data warehouse to unify data from multiple sources. By integrating **Vanna AI** and **GPT-4** for natural language querying and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the agent automates reporting, enables real-time dashboards, and delivers actionable insights for advisors and clients.  

Traditional methods of reporting are manual and fragmented, often requiring multiple tools and datasets. Microsoft Fabric solves these challenges by providing a centralized platform for structured and unstructured data, with built-in analytics and AI capabilities.

> **Note:** Completion of the **LLM Fine-Tuning Project** is recommended before starting this project.

## Introduction to Microsoft Fabric in Finance

Microsoft Fabric is a **unified data platform** that centralizes structured and unstructured data for streamlined analytics. OneLake acts as a single repository, combining lakehouse and warehouse capabilities for efficient storage and querying.  

With **text-to-SQL functionality** powered by Vanna AI, users can perform complex data queries using simple natural language, enabling non-technical stakeholders to interact with financial datasets effortlessly. Interactive dashboards provide real-time insights, trend monitoring, and decision support for wealth advisors and their clients.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end solution in Microsoft Fabric, consolidating data sources such as wealth assets, client portfolios, and transaction histories into a unified system for real-time financial analysis and reporting.
