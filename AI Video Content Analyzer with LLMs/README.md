# AI Project to Build a Video Content Analyzer with LLMs

## Overview

Videos are an increasingly important medium for education, media, and enterprise communication. However, extracting actionable insights, indexing content, and summarizing key points from long videos is time-consuming and challenging. This project introduces an **AI Video Content Analyzer** that uses LLMs to generate timestamped transcriptions, segment videos into chapters, and provide concise key insights for each segment.  

By combining **Whisper** for accurate audio transcription, **BLIP** for image captioning, and LLMs like **Gemini** and **GPT-4**, this project automates video analysis, creating structured, navigable outputs that enhance content accessibility, engagement, and discoverability.  

Traditional methods of video summarization are manual and labor-intensive, often missing critical details. This project streamlines the process, offering a scalable solution for educational content, media archives, and content discovery platforms.

> **Note:** Completion of the **LLM Fine-Tuning Project** is recommended before starting this project.

## Project Objectives

- Generate **timestamped transcriptions** from video audio using Whisper.  
- Perform **scene detection and image captioning** using BLIP.  
- Use **LLMs** (Gemini and GPT-4) to segment videos into chapters.  
- Extract **key insights and trends** for each chapter.  
- Provide structured, JSON-formatted outputs for easy navigation and analysis.

## Introduction to the Project

This project combines speech-to-text, computer vision, and LLM capabilities to automate video content analysis. Audio is transcribed with Whisper, visual frames are captioned with BLIP, and transcripts plus captions are analyzed with Gemini/GPT-4 to identify chapters, summarize content, and highlight important ideas.  

The structured output makes videos searchable, provides intuitive chapter navigation, and enables stakeholders to quickly extract valuable information from long content, improving productivity and engagement.

## Data Description

- **Input:** Educational video content, lectures, or media files.  
- **Output:**  
  - Timestamped transcriptions aligned with video frames.  
  - Chapters with titles and timestamps.  
  - Summaries and key insights for each chapter.  
  - JSON-formatted outputs for downstream applications.

## Solution Approach

### 1. Video Preprocessing
- Load video files and extract **audio** for transcription.  
- Extract **video frames** for visual analysis.

### 2. Timestamped Transcription
- Use **Whisper** to generate highly accurate transcriptions.  
- Include precise timestamps for sentence-level alignment with video.

### 3. Scene Detection
- Apply **BLIP** to analyze frames and generate captions for visual context.  
- Ensure captions are meaningful and aligned with audio timestamps.

### 4. Input Compilation
- Combine transcripts and scene captions into a unified dataset.  
- Validate timestamp alignment for accurate contextual analysis.

### 5. Contextual Analysis with LLMs
- Segment video into **chapters** based on thematic shifts or context changes.  
- Generate chapter titles and structured navigation.  
- Extract **key insights** and trends from combined transcript and visual captions.  
- Summarize content into concise **JSON outputs** containing:  
  - Chapter titles and timestamps  
  - Key points and insights  
  - Summarized content for quick review

## Expected Outcomes

By completing this project, you will:  
- Gain hands-on experience with **video transcription, scene detection, and LLM summarization**.  
- Learn to integrate **Whisper**, **BLIP**, and LLMs into a unified video analysis pipeline.  
- Build structured outputs that enhance accessibility, engagement, and content discoverability.  
- Automate video indexing and summarization for educational, media, and enterprise use cases.
