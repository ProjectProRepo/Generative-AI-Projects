# Microsoft Fabric Project to Build a Financial Reporting Agent

## Overview

This project leverages the powerful capabilities of **Microsoft Fabric** to streamline and modernize financial data handling and analysis in the wealth management domain. Microsoft Fabric's unified platform consolidates diverse financial datasets—such as client portfolios, transaction histories, and wealth assets—into **OneLake**, a centralized data warehouse. This ensures seamless access to structured and unstructured data through its **lakehouse** and **data warehouse** architecture.

By integrating **Dataflow Gen2**, this project automates data transfer from multiple sources into Fabric’s data warehouse, enabling scalable and efficient storage. The integration of **text-to-SQL capabilities** powered by **Vanna AI** allows users to query financial data using natural language, making insights more accessible for non-technical users. Additionally, an **interactive reporting dashboard** provides real-time analytics on portfolio performance, asset distribution, transaction histories, and financial projections.

This approach addresses key challenges in wealth management, such as fragmented data systems, inefficient report generation, and limited accessibility of financial insights. The solution empowers wealth advisors to manage portfolios effectively, optimize investment strategies, and deliver personalized recommendations while helping clients make informed financial decisions.
