# Build an Intelligent AI Personal Assistant using AutoGen

## Overview

Modern digital life involves juggling dozens of tools: emails, calendars, weather apps, and browsers, all aimed at improving productivity. Ironically, this abundance of tools often leads to fragmented workflows, wasted time, and decreased focus. The problem isn’t the tools themselves but the lack of a unified system that can intelligently coordinate and automate tasks across them.

This project introduces an **AI-powered personal assistant** built with **AutoGen**, a powerful framework for designing and orchestrating multi-agent systems. You will learn to create a network of AI agents that can handle day-to-day tasks such as managing emails, scheduling meetings, checking the weather, conducting research, and setting reminders—all through a natural conversational interface.  

By combining **AutoGen**, **OpenAI GPT-4o**, and external APIs like **Google Calendar**, **Gmail**, **Slack**, and **OpenWeatherMap**, this project demonstrates how intelligent automation can simplify your daily digital routine. The result is a personalized assistant that is context-aware, scalable, and capable of executing complex workflows efficiently.

> **Note:** This project serves as an advanced follow-up to the [LLM fine-tuning project](https://www.projectpro.io/project-use-case/llm-project-for-beginners-to-build-and-fine-tune-an-llm).

## Project Objectives

- Understand the **multi-agent systems architecture** and how AI agents collaborate to solve complex tasks.

- Understand **real-time conversation handling** and dynamic agent selection.  
- Implement **OAuth2 authentication** for secure Google integrations.  
- Build **Slack-integrated conversational interfaces** for accessible communication.  
- Learn how AutoGen supports end-to-end task execution, from natural language interpretation to response generation.

## Introduction to the AutoGen Agentic AI Project

Instead of relying on a single, monolithic assistant, this project builds a **collaborative network of AI agents** that can communicate and work together. Each agent is responsible for a specific function—handling emails, managing calendars, fetching weather updates, or performing research.  

This **multi-agent architecture** improves scalability, reliability, and the ability to handle complex workflows intelligently. It mirrors real-world teamwork but with AI-powered speed and precision.  

By integrating AutoGen with tools like **Gmail**, **Google Calendar**, **OpenWeatherMap**, and **Slack**, users can perform daily tasks through natural conversations—no switching between apps or writing code. The assistant processes commands, executes actions, and provides clear, context-aware responses in real time.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this project, ensure that you have:

- Completed the **LLM Project for building and fine-tuning a large language model**.  
- Basic understanding of **LLMs**, **Python**, and **FastAPI**.  
- Familiarity with API integrations and OAuth2 workflows.  
- Google Cloud credentials for accessing Gmail and Calendar APIs.  

> **Important:** Using Google APIs, OpenAI services, and cloud hosting may incur charges. Please review their documentation for pricing details. Tavily Search API and Slack integrations may also have associated costs, though free tiers are available for testing.

## How to Build an AutoGen Agent
