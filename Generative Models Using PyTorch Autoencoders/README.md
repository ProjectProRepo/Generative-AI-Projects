# Learn to Build Generative Models Using PyTorch Autoencoders  

## Overview  

This project explores **Generative Models** and their ability to create new data based on learned patterns. Unlike **Discriminative Models**, which classify data, **Generative Models** capture the underlying structure of data and generate realistic outputs.  

In this project, we will **build and train Autoencoders using PyTorch** and use them as **Generative Models** to create new digit images from the MNIST dataset. The Autoencoder consists of an **Encoder-Decoder architecture**, where the **Encoder compresses** the input data, and the **Decoder reconstructs** it. After training, the model will generate **new digit images**, demonstrating its ability to learn and produce realistic outputs.  

## Project Objectives  

- Understand the **difference between Discriminative and Generative Models**.  
- Learn the **applications of Generative Models** in AI and deep learning.  
- Explore **Autoencoder architecture** and its components (Encoder & Decoder).  
- Implement **Autoencoders using PyTorch**.  
- Train the model efficiently using **Google Colab with GPU support**.  
- Use Autoencoders as **Generative Models** to create new data.  

## Prerequisites  

Before starting this project, ensure you have:  

- **Basic knowledge of deep learning concepts**.  
- Familiarity with **PyTorch and neural networks**.  
- A **Google Colab account** (for GPU acceleration).  

## Data Description  

The project uses the **MNIST dataset**, which consists of:  

- **70,000 grayscale images** of handwritten digits (0â€“9).  
- Each image is **28x28 pixels** in size.  
- The dataset is commonly used for **classification and generative tasks**.  

## Tech Stack  

- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: torch, torchvision, torchinfo, numpy, matplotlib  
- **Hardware**: Google Colab (GPU-enabled for faster training)  

## Expected Outcomes  

By completing this project, you will:  

- Understand **Autoencoders and their role in Generative Models**.  
- Learn how to **build, train, and fine-tune an Autoencoder** in PyTorch.

- Gain hands-on experience with **PyTorch, neural networks, and GPU training**.  

## Important Notes  

- **Google Colab GPU Usage**: Training deep learning models on **GPU** accelerates performance. Ensure you select **GPU runtime** in Google Colab.  
- **Model Performance**: The quality of generated images depends on **training epochs, loss functions, and model architecture**.
