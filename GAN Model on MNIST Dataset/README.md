# PyTorch Project to Build a GAN Model on MNIST Dataset  

## Overview  

Have you ever wondered how **photo editing applications** can convert night images to day images? Or seen **realistic photos of people who don’t exist**? These are powered by **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**. GANs are widely used in **image-to-image translation, super-resolution, and generating photorealistic images** that even humans find hard to distinguish from real ones.  

In this project, we introduce **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and demonstrate how to build one using the **PyTorch** framework on the **MNIST dataset**. The **Generator model** will be trained to generate new images of handwritten digits, simulating realistic digit samples.  

## Project Objectives  

- Understand **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and their applications.  
- Learn about the **Generator and Discriminator** components in a GAN.  
- Explore the **architecture of GANs** and their **loss functions**.  
- Implement a **GAN model from scratch in PyTorch**.  
- Train the GAN model using **Google Colab with GPU acceleration**.  
- Generate **synthetic handwritten digits** using the trained **Generator model**.  

## Prerequisites  

Before starting this project, ensure you have:  

- Completed **Learn to Build Generative Models Using PyTorch Autoencoders**.  
- Basic knowledge of **Neural Networks and PyTorch**.  
- Understanding of **image transformations and deep learning concepts**.  
- Access to **Google Colab** for training with GPU acceleration.  

## Data Description  

This project uses the **MNIST dataset**, which contains **60,000 training** and **10,000 test images** of handwritten digits (0–9). Each image is **28x28 pixels in grayscale**, providing a simple yet effective dataset for training GAN models.  

## Tech Stack  

- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: PyTorch, Torchvision, NumPy, Matplotlib  

## Expected Outcomes  

By completing this project, you will:  

- Understand the **theory and working principles of GANs**.  
- Build a **GAN model in PyTorch from scratch**.  
- Train the model using **Google Colab with GPU acceleration**.  
- Generate **synthetic handwritten digit images** with the trained Generator model.  
- Gain insights into **common challenges in training GANs** and how to address them.  

## Challenges in Training GANs  

- **Mode Collapse**: The Generator produces similar outputs instead of diverse samples.  
- **Training Instability**: GANs require careful hyperparameter tuning for stable training.  
- **Vanishing Gradients**: The Discriminator may become too strong, leading to poor Generator learning.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Unlike supervised models, GANs don’t have a clear evaluation metric like accuracy.  

## Important Notes  

- **Google Colab GPU Usage**: Training GANs requires significant computational power. Ensure you enable **GPU acceleration in Colab** (`Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU`).  
- **Tuning GANs**: Experiment with different **learning rates, architectures, and loss functions** to improve results.

- Train the model on a **larger dataset** such as **CIFAR-10 or CelebA**.  
- Implement **Conditional GAN (cGAN)** to generate digits based on input labels.  
- Experiment with **different loss functions** to enhance training stability.
