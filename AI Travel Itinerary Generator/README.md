# Build an AI Travel Itinerary Generator with Stable Diffusion Models

## Overview

In today’s travel and hospitality industry, personalization has become a key driver of customer satisfaction and loyalty. Travelers expect itineraries that reflect their unique preferences, from destinations and activities to visual aesthetics. This project introduces an **AI-powered Travel Itinerary Generator** that creates stunning, personalized visuals for travel plans using **Stable Diffusion** and **InstructPix2Pix** models.  

By combining structured customer data with generative AI techniques, the system produces customized travel images aligned with individual interests—romantic getaways, family adventures, or solo expeditions—enhancing engagement and marketing effectiveness.

Traditional content creation for travel marketing often relies on photographers, designers, and stock images. While visually appealing, these methods are expensive, time-consuming, and lack scalability. This project leverages **Generative AI** to automate the process, delivering dynamic, high-quality visuals that adapt to customer demographics and travel preferences.

> **Note:** Completion of the **LLM Fine-Tuning Project** is recommended before attempting this project.

## Project Objectives

- Automate the **generation of personalized travel visuals** using AI image models.  
- Utilize **customer-specific details** (e.g., destination, activity type, demographics) for image generation.  
- Learn **prompt engineering techniques** for travel-related visual content.  
- Explore **AI-based personalization** in marketing and travel planning workflows.  
- Build an end-to-end pipeline that integrates **data processing, AI model configuration, and image generation**.

## Introduction to the Project

This project focuses on building a system that transforms structured customer data into customized travel imagery. The workflow begins with processing inputs such as traveler demographics, preferred destinations, and itinerary details.  

Using **Google Gemini** for prompt generation and **Stable Diffusion** (along with **InstructPix2Pix**) for image synthesis, the system generates visuals that align with user preferences. The resulting images enhance travel itineraries and marketing materials, allowing agencies and hospitality platforms to deliver deeply personalized, emotionally resonant experiences at scale.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that you have:

- Completed the **LLM Fine-Tuning Project**.  
- Proficiency in **Python** and experience with virtual environments.  
- Understanding of **prompt engineering** for text-to-image workflows.  
- Familiarity with **diffusion models** and **image generation pipelines**.  

> **Note:** GPU-enabled platforms may incur computational costs. Review documentation carefully before proceeding.

## Aim

The goal of this project is to build a **Generative AI system** that creates personalized visuals for travel itineraries, improving user engagement and marketing efficiency for the travel and hospitality sector.

---

## Data Description

- **Customer Demographics:** Age group, location, and traveler type (solo, family, couple).  
- **Travel Preferences:** Destinations, activities, and travel themes (e.g., luxury, adventure, cultural).  
- **Itinerary Details:** Duration, season, and daily activity descriptions.  
- This data is structured into prompts that guide AI-based image generation.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.10  
- **Libraries:** pandas, transformers, diffusers, stable-diffusion, google-generativeai  
- **Models:** Google Gemini, Stable Diffusion (v1.4, v1.5, or XL), InstructPix2Pix  

---

## Solution Approach

### 1. Data Preparation and Model Configuration
- Process and structure customer data into a format suitable for generating prompts.  
- Configure and initialize AI models like **Gemini**, **Stable Diffusion**, and **InstructPix2Pix**.  
- Fine-tune model parameters for stable, high-quality outputs.

### 2. Prompt Engineering
- Craft rich, context-aware prompts reflecting travel themes and customer preferences.  
- Include specifics like landmarks, lighting, season, and mood.  
- Ensure each prompt aligns closely with the target customer persona.

### 3. Image Generation
- Generate visuals using **Stable Diffusion** and **InstructPix2Pix**.  
- Validate the output for relevance, visual appeal, and contextual alignment with the itinerary.  
- Automate iterative generation for multiple itinerary stages or destinations.

### 4. Customization and Enhancement
- Enable optional visual modifications (e.g., lighting adjustments, landmark inclusion).  
- Refine generated images using user feedback loops or ranking mechanisms.  
- Integrate enhancements for seasonal or theme-based customization.
