# Build an AI Picture Book Generator using Stable Diffusion Models

## Overview

Creating illustrated storybooks traditionally involves authors, illustrators, and editors, making the process time-consuming and costly. This project introduces an **AI-powered Picture Book Generator** that automates both story writing and illustration creation.  

Using **Google Gemini** for narrative generation and **Stable Diffusion** for image synthesis, the system produces complete, personalized children’s picture books. Each story includes structured plot segments, a detailed protagonist, and accompanying illustrations, enabling fully automated, creative, and interactive storytelling.

By combining **LLM-based text generation** with **diffusion-based image synthesis**, this project demonstrates how generative AI can streamline book creation while maintaining creativity and visual consistency.

> **Note:** Completion of the **LLM fine-tuning project** is recommended before starting this project.

## Project Objectives

- Generate **cohesive stories** with clear plot progression and moral lessons using Google Gemini.  
- Create **visual illustrations** aligned with story events using Stable Diffusion.  
- Maintain **character consistency** across multiple story scenes.  
- Learn to structure prompts for **multi-modal AI outputs**.  
- Build an automated workflow for producing complete AI-generated picture books.  
- Explore practical applications of **generative AI in creative and educational domains**.

## Introduction to the Project

This project demonstrates how **multi-modal AI** can combine text and image generation to produce children’s picture books efficiently. Gemini generates structured narratives divided into five story segments, each containing challenges, resolutions, and moral takeaways.  

Stable Diffusion produces illustrations that correspond to story segments, with image-to-image generation used to ensure the protagonist and visual style remain consistent throughout the book. The result is an **end-to-end AI storytelling system**, capable of creating both content and illustrations automatically.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Completed the **LLM fine-tuning project**.  
- Knowledge of **Python** and managing virtual environments.  
- Familiarity with **prompt engineering** for text and image generation.  
- Basic understanding of **diffusion models**.  

> **Note:** GPU-enabled platforms may incur usage costs. Review the platform documentation to understand pricing before proceeding.

## Aim

The goal of this project is to develop an **AI-powered picture book generator** that produces engaging, personalized stories and illustrations using **generative language and image models**, enabling scalable, automated creative content generation.

---

## Data Description

- **Textual Data:** Stories generated dynamically using Gemini based on predefined themes.  
- **Visual Data:** Illustrations generated by Stable Diffusion, following the story narrative and protagonist description.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.10  
- **Libraries:** pandas, transformers, diffusers, stable-diffusion, torch  
- **Models:** Google Gemini, Stable Diffusion (v1.4, v1.5, or XL)

---

## Solution Approach

### 1. Story Generation
- Generate **narratives** using Google Gemini.  
- Include themes like **adventure, friendship, and moral lessons**.  
- Structure each story into **five distinct parts** covering introduction, conflict, climax, resolution, and takeaway.

### 2. Protagonist Design
- Create detailed descriptions including **appearance, clothing, and personality traits**.  
- Ensure consistency across all story scenes.

### 3. Visual Prompt Creation
- Develop prompts specifying **scene details, emotions, actions, and environment**.  
- Use these prompts to guide Stable Diffusion for accurate illustrations.

### 4. Image Generation
- Generate base images for the protagonist.  
- Use **image-to-image generation** for subsequent scenes to maintain consistency.  
- Produce high-quality illustrations that align with the story’s events and tone.

## Expected Outcomes

After completing this project, you will:

- Understand **multi-modal AI workflows** for creative content generation.  
- Learn to generate **structured stories and aligned illustrations**.  
- Gain experience in **prompt design for text and image models**.  
- Build an AI system capable of creating **complete children’s picture books** autonomously.
