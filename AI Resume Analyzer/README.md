# Build and Deploy an AI Resume Analyzer with OpenAI and Azure

## Overview

In the competitive job market, understanding how well a candidate's resume aligns with a job description is crucial not just for employers but also for job seekers. Traditional resume screening methods, typically employed by companies, rely heavily on keyword-based filtering systems. While useful, these systems often miss the subtleties in resumes and job descriptions, potentially leading to overlooked opportunities and a lack of constructive feedback for candidates.

This project addresses the needs of job seekers who want to proactively assess their resumes against job descriptions, identify gaps, and receive personalized insights on how to improve. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our AI-powered resume reviewer goes beyond simple keyword matching to understand the context and content of both resumes and job descriptions. This enables the system to provide more accurate matching and detailed suggestions for enhancement.

The project will allow users to upload job descriptions and resumes, generate embeddings for both, and calculate similarity scores using cosine similarity. Beyond matching, the system will analyze the resume against the job description to highlight areas for improvement, offering suggestions such as relevant skills, action words, and formatting tips. Finally, the application will be deployed on Azure, ensuring it is scalable and accessible to users seeking to refine their resumes and improve their job prospects.

## Project Objectives

- Automate resume analysis using LLMs.
- Generate accurate and context-aware similarity scores between resumes and job descriptions.
- Provide AI-driven suggestions for improving resumes based on identified gaps.
- Utilize Azure for scalable deployment and management.
- Develop a user-friendly Streamlit interface for seamless interaction.
