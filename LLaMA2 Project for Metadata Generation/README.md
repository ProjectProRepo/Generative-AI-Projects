# Llama2 Project for Metadata Generation using FAISS and RAGs

## Overview

Metadata refers to descriptive information about data that provides context, meaning, and structure. In simpler terms, metadata is "data about data." It plays a crucial role in organizing, managing, and understanding various types of information.

### Examples of Metadata:
- **Text Document**: Author, Title, Word Count, File Format
- **Web Page**: URL, Last Modified, Meta Tags

This descriptive information aids in efficient search and retrieval, allowing users to find relevant data quickly. Metadata ensures proper interpretation of data, supporting decision-making processes. In diverse fields like libraries, archives, and digital asset management, metadata enhances workflow efficiency and fosters interoperability. Generally, metadata is created by manually documenting relevant details associated with the data.

Manual metadata creation can be time-intensive, requiring meticulous effort and attention to detail. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a transformative solution to streamline this workflow. By leveraging advanced natural language processing capabilities, LLMs can automate metadata generation, drastically reducing the time and effort required for manual entry. Integrating LLMs into metadata creation workflows enhances accuracy, consistency, and efficiency.

In this project, we implement a metadata generation system using **Llama2** and **FAISS Vector Database**. The system leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques to retrieve relevant information before generating metadata, improving quality and relevance.

## Project Objectives

- Automate metadata generation using **Llama2** and **FAISS**.
- Utilize **RAG techniques** for improved metadata retrieval and generation.
- Implement a **vector database** for efficient metadata storage and management.
- Configure **AWS EC2 instances** for GPU-intensive tasks.
- Develop a **streamlined pipeline** for metadata extraction and question-answering.
- Enhance workflow efficiency by reducing manual efforts in metadata creation.

## Prerequisites
