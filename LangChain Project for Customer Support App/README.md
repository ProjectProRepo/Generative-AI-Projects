# LangChain Project for Customer Support App in Python  

## Overview  

This project focuses on enhancing **customer support interactions** using **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, enabling **intelligent and context-aware responses**. With **LangChain**, we seamlessly integrate LLM technology with **databases, PDF knowledge bases, and audio processing agents** to create a **comprehensive customer support application**.  

LangChain simplifies the development of chatbots, virtual agents, and automation workflows, making it one of the fastest-growing open-source projects since its introduction in 2022. This project demonstrates how **multi-agent architectures**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, and **speech-to-text AI models** can significantly improve **customer service efficiency**.  

## Project Objectives  

- Understand **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and their role in **customer support automation**.  
- Learn about the **LangChain Framework** and its structure for **multi-step workflows**.  
- Implement **custom output parsers** and **ReACT prompt engineering**.  
- Explore **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)** and **graph-based LLM workflows**.  
- Develop a **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system** for **context-based responses**.  
- Implement **multi-retrieval chains** to interact with external databases.  
- Utilize **Whisper (OpenAI) for speech-to-text** in voice-based interactions.  

## Prerequisites  

Before starting this project, ensure you have:  

- **Basic knowledge of LangChain and LLMs**.  
- Familiarity with **Python and API integrations**.  
- Understanding of **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows**.  
- An **OpenAI API key** (usage may require free credits or additional purchases).  

## Data Description  

The project leverages multiple data sources, including:  

- **User interaction logs** for tracking customer queries.  
- **PDF knowledge bases** for retrieving relevant support articles.  
- **Databases** containing **user details, subscriptions, and past interactions**.  

## Tech Stack  

- **Language**: Python 3.10.4  
- **Libraries**: sentence-transformers, OpenAI, LangChain, ChromaDB, Streamlit  
- **AI Models**: GPT-4, Whisper (OpenAI)  

## Expected Outcomes  

By completing this project, you will:  

- Build a **multi-agent LLM-powered customer support app**.  
- Implement **graph-based workflows** for **conversation handling**.  
- Utilize **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** for **context-aware responses**.  
- Integrate **speech-to-text AI models** for **phone call transcription and summarization**.  
- Develop a **ticketing system** for unresolved queries.  

## Important Notes  

- **OpenAI API Usage**: Using OpenAI models (GPT-4, Whisper) may require free credits or additional payments.  
- **Deprecation Notice**: GPT-DV-Canva has been deprecated by OpenAI; the project now runs on **GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4**.
